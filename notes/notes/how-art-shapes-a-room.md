# How Art Shapes a Room

January 17, 2026

I’ve been thinking a lot about restraint lately.

Not filling every wall. Not layering endlessly. Letting one piece carry the weight of the room.

Art doesn’t need to match everything to belong.
It needs space, contrast, and intention.

Mosaic pieces, especially, demand that kind of respect.
They’re not background. They’re anchors.

This is the direction I’m leaning into here:
fewer pieces, chosen carefully, letting the room breathe around them.
