  <h1>A Perfect Reset Day</h1>
  <p><em>January 16, 2026</em></p>

  <p>
    Yesterday wasn’t about productivity or routines.  
    It was about creating a pause.
  </p>

  <p>
    I noticed how much my space affects how I reset —  
    light, texture, softness, and silence doing more than any checklist ever could.
  </p>

  <p>
    This is what I want <strong>The Neutral Edit</strong> to be about:
    rooms that support how we live, not just how they look.
