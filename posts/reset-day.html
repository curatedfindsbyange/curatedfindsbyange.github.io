    <p>Like everyone else, life gets loud.</p>

    <p>
      Bills to pay, a house that never quite stays clean, family, responsibilities — and lately,
      a brand new world I’m learning how to navigate: Pinterest.
    </p>

    <p>
      I’ve been learning something new every single day. A lot, actually.
      And yesterday, I realized I needed to pause.
    </p>

    <p><strong>To reset.</strong></p>

    <p>
      A reset looks different for everyone.
      For me, it’s not productivity or routines or perfectly planned mornings.
    </p>

    <p>
      Honestly? It’s staying in bed, watching TV, and letting my brain go quiet for a while.
    </p>

    <p>
      I’m not proud of this, but I love Hallmark movies.
      I don’t know why. I’m usually not into poorly acted, overly predictable films —
      but something about them feels safe. Familiar. Soft.
      Maybe it’s the most basic part of me. I’ve accepted it.
    </p>

    <p>
      Reset also looks like taking care of my plants.
    </p>

    <p>
      This is a new thing for me. I used to kill plants. Constantly.
      Now I kill fewer of them — which feels like progress.
    </p>

    <p>
      I spend time pruning, watering, learning how to propagate.
      I know I don’t need to check the roots five times a day while they sit in a jar of water…
      but I still do. Every time I walk into the kitchen, I look.
      Waiting for that one strand to grow.
    </p>

    <p>It makes me happy.</p>

    <p>
      I’m not a journaling person. I’ve tried. Even my therapist suggested it.
      It never really stuck.
    </p>

    <p>
      But maybe this is my version of it.
    </p>

    <p>
      A place to slow down. To notice how space, light, texture, and quiet
      actually affect how I feel.
    </p>

    <p>
      This is what I want <em>The Neutral Edit</em> to be about.
      Not perfect homes — but spaces that support real life.
    </p>

    <p>
      This is my first post.
      And if you’re here, welcome.
