    <h1>Still in Pieces</h1>
    <div class="date">January 17, 2026</div>

    <p>Today was mosaic day.</p>

    <p>
      I’ve been an affiliate for a couple of weeks now, and my Pinterest account itself is barely a month and a half old — so everything still feels new.
    </p>

    <p>
      You can’t underdo mosaic. It has to be intentional. Thought through. And when everything is beautiful, choosing one feels impossible.
    </p>

    <p>
      At first, I tried to approach it the “right” way — looking for lifestyle images, pieces shown in living rooms or over fireplaces. But they didn’t translate. The beauty flattened. The work looked cheaper than it actually is, and that bothered me.
    </p>

    <p>So I stopped forcing it.</p>

    <p>
      I pulled the pieces I genuinely loved into Canva. There were a lot — probably thirty. I blew them up, sat with them, and slowly narrowed them down to the ones that actually spoke to me.
    </p>

    <p>
      The first slide was instant. The line work. The colors. How simple movement becomes a human form. It’s incredible.
    </p>

    <p>
      The second reminds me of Curitiba — not literally, but in feeling. The pedestrian walkways in some parts of the city have that same mosaic rhythm. I couldn’t not include it.
    </p>

    <p>
      The third piece changed. It was originally a white peacock — stunning, but wrong for the set. I wanted cohesion, not just beauty.
    </p>

    <p>
      The fourth needed space. Blown up, it finally breathed.
    </p>

    <p>
      And the last piece came from stillness. From a reset day. From sitting quietly and thinking about life — and realizing something was still missing.
    </p>

    <p>So I went back.</p>

    <p>
      I’ll be honest: I was looking for nudes. I wanted a focal point. A shabang. Something unapologetic.
    </p>

    <p>And then I found <strong>her</strong>.</p>

    <p>
      She became today’s product pin and the entire center of the post. The colors. The structure of her face. The way she looks directly at you even without visible eyes. There’s an expression there — confident, grounded, powerful. A complete fucking badass.
    </p>

    <p>
      She deserved to be the focal point. <strong>Anyone’s focal point</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you’re reading this, that’s why I chose her. I hope you paused because of her. I hope you came here because something about that piece made you stop scrolling.
    </p>

    <p>
      And if you have the money — buy it. Truly. I would hang it over my bed without a second thought.
    </p>

    <p>Still in pieces. Still intentional.</p>

    <p>Thanks for reading.</p>
